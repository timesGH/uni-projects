            <pre>I have done Software Design and Systems and Multimedia for HSC subjects. 

I learnt how to utilise the Adobe Softwares, such as Premiere Pro and Animate, also briefly went through
about the basic level of algorithms and project developments such as Agile.

We also learnt how to use C#,C and python (basic level).

Other HSC subjects were:

    • English - EAL/D

    • Mathematics Advanced

    • Japanese Beginners

            <pre>Since I am only a second year university student, I did not get a lot of chance to get into IT industry jobs.

I could get a chance to work at the company called Cruiser for 2 weeks for my highschool work experience. 
I learnt how to do basic coding in real world industry, and to do user testing for their developing software.

I am also currently working at the coding tutoring work called CodeCamp. Since this work is to teach 
underage students(5 to 12 years old) about basic coding, It helps me to reinforce my basic coding 
knowledge by teaching the logic behind. 

Besides these, I used to work at Maccas for 8 months, and learnt how to deal against customers.
