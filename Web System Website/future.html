            <pre>In the future, I really want to go to cloud side of IT. I am not very certain about their job right now, but from 
the resaerch that I have done throughout the school holidays, it sounds very interesting to learn and to work 
on in the future.

My plan is to achieve the decent marks for all my subjects in 2022 semesters, and try to find the 
network/cloud side internship. Knowing the theory and actually working in the industry are very different, 
therefore I want to see how everything goes in the actual industry to check whether it fits myself.

I am also planning to get certificates related to networking and cloud, such as CCNA and AWS Associate by
the end of this year. This will help me to prove to the hiring companies that I have enough expert knowledge,
and prepared to get into the industry without any problems.

I do acknowledge that the cloud computing industry is developing and changing very fast, so anything that
I learn can be completely changed within few years. However, I am very confident that I can keep up with the
changes and new technologies, and to easily adopt myself to follow the pace.
